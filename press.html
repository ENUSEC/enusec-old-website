<h3>testimonals</h3>
<p><i>Having founded the Society in 2015, I am ecstatic to see how it has grown since then. From about a dozen of passionate students,
I often look back with emotion and see how far it has come with the help and energy of so many.
I trust it will live long and have high hopes in its current committee, as well as future ones, to take it to the next levels.

<p><i>One of the things we are most proud of is our students and graduates. 
ENUSEC thus showcases our students at their best, and as smart and confident individuals who work together. 
They have pride in their work and have a strive towards excellence in both their academic study and in their advancements in Cybersecurity. 
Within ENUSEC there is a positive attitude in the pursuit of gaining knowledge from others, and also to freely share their knowledge with others. 
We also see the leaders of our future evolving within ENUSEC, and with individuals who have a dedication to build a more secure and robust world.
