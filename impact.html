      "Having founded the Society in 2015, I am ecstatic to see how it has grown since then. From about a dozen of passionate students,
      I often look back with emotion and see how far it has come with the help and energy of so many.
      I trust it will live long and have high hopes in its current committee, as well as future ones, to take it to the next levels."

      "When creating ENUSEC with Charley Celice at the beginning of 2015, we had no
idea if it would be popular, how long it would last, or if it would be at all
useful. The aim of the society was not only to encourage students with an
interest in cyber security and help with technical skills. The community ethos which the society was
based on was intended to bring together undergrad and postgrad students from
across the years of the various courses to support each other, as well as to
interact with the growing wider infosec community. I'm amazed at efforts by
all the students who have been involved over the years and how far we
have come, with some amazing large scale events, strong integration with
industry, the current variety of weekly ENUSEC activities, working with other
cyber societies, and competing in events all over the UK, but more than
anything the social and community aspects involving students and alumni is
inspirational."

        ENUSEC thus showcases our students at their best, and as smart and confident individuals who work together.
        They have pride in their work and have a strive towards excellence in both their academic study and in their advancements in Cybersecurity.
        Within ENUSEC there is a positive attitude in the pursuit of gaining knowledge from others, and also to freely share their knowledge with others.
        We also see the leaders of our future evolving within ENUSEC, and with individuals who have a dedication to build a more secure and robust world."

      “I am delighted to see the society's constant progression over the years.
      We started as a small group, doing CTF on the side, and at the time, going to the pub was an event.
      Now it has grown to be a connection between Napier and the wider Infosec community and reaches far wider than we ever thought it initially would.”
