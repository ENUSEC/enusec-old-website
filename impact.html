      "Having founded the Society in 2015, I am ecstatic to see how it has grown since then. From about a dozen of passionate students, 
      I often look back with emotion and see how far it has come with the help and energy of so many. 
      I trust it will live long and have high hopes in its current committee, as well as future ones, to take it to the next levels."
