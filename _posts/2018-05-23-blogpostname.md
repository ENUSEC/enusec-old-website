# Introducing the Cyber Security Societies Directory

To aid interaction and collaboration, ENUSEC has created a public directory containing all the cyber security societies across the country. This directory is available on our [GitHub!](https://github.com/ENUSEC/UK-University-CyberSec-Societies-Lookup)


A problem which occurred during the compiling this list was difficulty in determining if a society was focused on cyber security. When a first draft list was compiled, it contained over 30 societies. However, on further investigation some of these societies who appeared to be more general computing focused or simply CTF teams. 


If you feel that your society should be on this list, then feel free to contribute to the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/ENUSEC/UK-University-CyberSec-Societies-Lookup) or approach a member of ENUSEC at an event.


We hope this directory is the start of a blossoming nationwide cyber security community.
