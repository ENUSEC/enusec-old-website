# Fall 2019 Call for Labs

Have an area of relative expertise, a disseration you're proud of, a slide deck you want to practice before a conference? Come show off at an ENUSEC meetup this Fall! ENUSEC meets on Wednesday 1PM in C27 Merchiston Campus Edinburgh, and this year we're using a google form to stay organized and give members a heads-up on who's talking when. 

Submit your lab [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgKoaaPYvrUO-x9MTuYNMdcQ6X71l20LGuvOIcXonTqP-i8g/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

All levels of expertise and all areas related to information security are encouraged.

Feel free to share comments and/or concerns with @\_enusec\_ or team@enusec.org. 

Thank you and we look forward to seeing you next Spring!
