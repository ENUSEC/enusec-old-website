# LTDH20 Call For Sponsors

After a restful summer, ENUSEC is gearing up for next years Le Tour Du Hack 2020, and we need your help.

If you're not familiar ENUSEC, Le Tour Du Hack is our flagship annual event. Le Tour Du Hack 2019 was a sell-out success, welcoming 230 students and professionals with a two-track conference followed by a student-led CTF. We plan on taking this momentum forward into <b style="color:#61949a;">#LTDH20</b>.
