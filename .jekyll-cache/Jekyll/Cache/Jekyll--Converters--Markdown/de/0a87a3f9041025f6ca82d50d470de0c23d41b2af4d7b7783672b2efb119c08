<p>After a restful summer, ENUSEC is gearing up for next year’s Le Tour Du Hack 2020, and we need your help.</p>

<p>If you or your company is interested in learning more about the event or the help we need, you can check out  <a href="https://enusec.org/LTDH20/">LTDH20’s website</a> and download our <a href="./CFS.pdf">sponsorship pack</a>!</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar ENUSEC, Le Tour Du Hack is our flagship annual event. Le Tour Du Hack 2019 was a sell-out success, welcoming 230 students and professionals with a two-track conference followed by a student-led CTF. We plan on taking this momentum forward into <b style="color:#61949a;">#LTDH20</b>.</p>

<p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you next Spring!</p>
