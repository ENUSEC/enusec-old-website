<p>Have an area of relative expertise, a disseration youâ€™re proud of, a slide deck you want to practice before a conference? Come show off at an ENUSEC meetup this Fall! ENUSEC meets on Wednesday 1PM in C27 Merchiston Campus Edinburgh, and this year weâ€™re using a google form to stay organized and give members a heads-up on whoâ€™s talking when.</p>

<p>All levels of expertise and all areas related to information security are encouraged.</p>

<p>Feel free to share comments and/or concerns with @<em>enusec</em> or team@enusec.org.</p>

<p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you next Spring!</p>
