If youâ€™re not familiar ENUSEC, Le Tour Du Hack is our flagship annual event. Le Tour Du Hack 2019 was a sell-out success, welcoming 230 students and professionals with a two-track conference followed by a student-led CTF. We plan on taking this momentum forward into <b style="color:#61949a;">#LTDH20</b>.</p>

<p>Thank you and we look forward to seeing you next Spring!</p>
