<p>After a restful summer, ENUSEC is gearing up for next years Le Tour Du Hack 2020, and we need your help.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re not familiar ENUSEC, Le Tour Du Hack is our flagship annual event. Le Tour Du Hack 2019 was a sell-out success, welcoming 230 students and professionals with a two-track conference followed by a student-led CTF. We plan on taking this momentum forward into <b style="color:#61949a;">#LTDH20</b>.</p>
