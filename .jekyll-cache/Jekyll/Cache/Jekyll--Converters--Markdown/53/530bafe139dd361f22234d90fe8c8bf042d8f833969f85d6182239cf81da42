<p>To aid interaction and collaboration, ENUSEC has created a public directory containing all the cyber security societies across the country. This directory is available on our <a href="https://github.com/ENUSEC/UK-University-CyberSec-Societies-Lookup">GitHub!</a></p>

<p>A problem which occurred during the compiling this list was difficulty in determining if a society was focused on cyber security. When a first draft list was compiled, it contained over 30 societies. However, on further investigation some of these societies who appeared to be more general computing focused or simply CTF teams.</p>

<p>If you feel that your society should be on this list, then feel free to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/ENUSEC/UK-University-CyberSec-Societies-Lookup">public GitHub repository</a> or approach a member of ENUSEC at an event.</p>

<p>We hope this directory is the start of a blossoming nationwide cyber security community.</p>
