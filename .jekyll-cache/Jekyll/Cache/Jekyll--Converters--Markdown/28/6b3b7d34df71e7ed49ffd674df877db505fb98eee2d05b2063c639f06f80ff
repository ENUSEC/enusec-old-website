  <p>We‚Äôve found one of C&amp;C servers that controlled recent DDoS attack, however we can‚Äôt get credentials.
http://master.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:3333
Also, we‚Äôve got a communication traffic dump between C&amp;C servers.
capture.pcap
Can you get in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This challenge starts out by analysing a pcap file with network traces from the C&amp;C servers which constituse a lot of communication. To limit the amount of packets to analyse a filter is used as shown on the first line in below code snippet. First line uses 3 filters that represents the 3-way TCP handshake and the most interesting connections is shown on the second line starting with packet number 108.</p>

<p>Using the ‚Äúfollow tcp‚Äù stream on packet 108 shows a lot of database trafic including usernames and passwords. The usernames and passwords cold potentially be used to access the website provided in the challenge and indeed testing with the one from below snippet gives a ‚Äúno flag for you‚Äù response. There we are, somewhat on the right track but with a wall of text to exstract credentials from.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To quickly grab all credentials we use a regular expression as such as[_a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[^\.|\W]{24,}+ and then copy/paste the matches to a textfile. The result is 499 lines with credentials to try against the website. We tried a lot of credentials without finding a flag and later realised that some of the credentials didnt work because the passwords were too long compared to the other users.</p>

<p>Next step was therefore searching through the credentials again and try those with longer passwords. Interestingly, the admin credentials was amongst those with long credentials and we manually tested with the full password, then with the full password minus the last char, then again minus another and ‚Ä¶ see below c‚Äù,)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs a old goverment web-site. Please, don‚Äôt touch that. It works properly.
http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Browsing to the website <a href="http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080">http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080</a> and clicking around shows that each page is requested through URI ID‚Äôs using GET requests and the following table show‚Äôs the clickable links and how they map to ID‚Äôs. The ID‚Äôs are mapped by simply browsing around and enumerating the site and its functionality.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>URI ID</th>
      <th>Site content</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>36</td>
      <td>Contact</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>33</td>
      <td>About</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Bulky waste collection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>23</td>
      <td>Council Tax</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Interestingly, the ID‚Äôs are jumping quite a bit which could be hint that there‚Äôs something to discover here and trying to access <a href="http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080/page?id=3">http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080/page?id=3</a> gives a page not found. Using Burp Suite, its easy and quick to enumerate these ID‚Äôs using the intruder-function and adjusting the parameter with a payload of numbers starting at 1-1000 in increments of 1.</p>

<p>Below picture shows the result from Burp which is sorted by lenght and now reveals a URI ID=18 (top one) with a length of 5000. Browsing to the <a href="http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080/page?id=18">http://old-government-site.quals.2018.volgactf.ru:8080/page?id=18</a> shows a page about ‚ÄúPrivate garbage company‚Äù with a form submission.
<img src="/img/2018-03-25-oldGovBurp.png" alt="Burp output after enumerating URI id's" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Right, so we can now post something to the website but its still uncertain what is happening with the content submitted in the form. Returning to Burp, capturing a form submission and sending this to the repeater allows for easy manipulation and understanding of the response caused by adjusting arguments, headers, id‚Äôs and so on. Unfortunately, it was not possible so see anything from the response within Burp but trying to inject another OS command such as ping could possibly be observed on our VPS.</p>

<p>As such, we setup a filter on our VPS to show only ICMP packets and started to fuzz the form submission with different OS command injection parameters such as <strong>; |  ${} &amp;&amp;</strong> and so on. Tadaaaa, a pipe was working and as can be seen below we managed to get the old goverment site to send a ping back to the VPS.</p>

<p>Natural next step, change the OS command injection to setup a reverse shell back to our VPS.</p>

<p>To grab the reverse shell we used a VPS with an open netcat listener and waited for the callback from the Old Goverment Website. Below is a dump of the output from the VPS showing a sucessfull callback from the website. We now have a reverse shell and the flag was found in the root directory.</p>
